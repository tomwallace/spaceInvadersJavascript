The goal of this project is to write a game in JavaScript as a fun activity to do with my kids.  It began by watching
a live coding demonstration by Mary Rose Cook at Front-Trends 2014, where she recreated the game Space Invaders in
JavaScript.  You can find a video of the demonstration here:

I got about half way through the demonstration during lunch one day.  Then I showed the results to my kids, who were
surprisingly interested, not just in the game, but in the coding process.  From that point forward, I stopped watching
the video and we started coding features they wanted in the game.  It was a great experience for me, as I shared some
of the ideas behind Agile software development with them - groomed backlog, prioritizing features, flexible coding decisions
, etc. - using words I felt they could understand.

In the end, we had a great time and this game is the result, and it continues to develop.  I wanted to put it up on GitHub
to share with others and potentially inspire people to make time to share experiences like this with their kids, as it
is both fun and rewarding.
